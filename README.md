# MediaSafe-Cloud

## Overview
MediaSafe Cloud will be self-hosted that runs on HP ProLiant MicroServer Generation 8 hardware. The main focus of doing project at this moment in time is to learn the IT fundermentals such as Operating systems, networking, databases, security, programming and containerization. The purpose and reasoning of doing this project is because there is a growing volume of photos and videos on mobile devices phone which isn't suistanble in the long-term for mobile devices. These medias need to be stored securely, organized efficiently and remain accessible long-term. 

## Business Problem
The business problem that led to this project is that many small and self-starting businesses rely on Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) file and media hosting platforms such as Google One and Dropbox. While convenient, these services increase ongoing costs and reduce control over data privacy.

Additionally, some small companies and freelancers depend on large numbers of external Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid-State Drives (SSDs) to store photos and videos. This approach creates risks because the data is often not properly backed up, and the physical drives can be easily lost or stolen. If that happens, sensitive photos and videos may be exposed.

## Business Targets

- Provide a secure cloud storage for files, photos and videos.
- Enable remote access for users.
- Implement automated backups.
- Showcase fundementals such as OS, networking, databases, security, programming, containerzation.
