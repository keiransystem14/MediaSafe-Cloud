# MediaSafe-Cloud

## Overview
MediaSafe Cloud will be self-hosted that runs on HP ProLiant MicroServer Generation 8 hardware. The main focus of doing project is to learn the IT fundermentals such as Operating systems, networking, databases, security, programming and containerization.

## Business Problem
The current business problem which led me to doing this project is small and self-starter businesses rely on Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) file/media hosting such as Google Drive and Dropbox, which adds increased costs and risk of not having any control of the data.

## Business Targets

- Provide a secure cloud storage for files, photos and videos.
- Enable remote access for employees.
- Implement automated backups.
- Showcase fundementals such as OS, networking, databases, security, programming, containerzation.
