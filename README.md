# MediaSafe-Cloud

## Overview
MediaSafe Cloud will be self-hosted that runs on HP ProLiant MicroServer Generation 8 hardware. The main focus of doing project is to learn the IT fundermentals such as Operating systems, networking, databases, security, programming and containerization. The purpose and reasoning of doing this project is because there is a growing volume of photos and videos on mobile devices phone which isn't suistanble in the long-term for mobile devices. These medias need to be stored securely, organized efficiently and remain accessible long-term. 

## Business Problem
The current business problem which led me to doing this project is small and self-starter businesses rely on Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) file/media hosting such as Google One and Dropbox, which adds increased costs and risk of not having any control of the data privacy. 

## Business Targets

- Provide a secure cloud storage for files, photos and videos.
- Enable remote access for employees.
- Implement automated backups.
- Showcase fundementals such as OS, networking, databases, security, programming, containerzation.
